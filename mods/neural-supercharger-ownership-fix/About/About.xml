  <description>## Neural Supercharger Ownership Fix

### Problem:
- **Register the same load ID twice**: Duplicate load IDs when loading saves with neural superchargers
- The mod saves pawn assignments but sometimes registers the same ID twice, causing save/load errors

### Solution:
- Prefix patches on PostExposeData methods that deduplicate the lists of assigned pawns/buildings
- Removes duplicate entries before they're saved/loaded

### Load Order:
Place AFTER the Neural Supercharger Ownership mod in your mod list.

### Patches:
- Patch_CompNeuralSuperchargerOwnership_PostExposeData: Deduplicates owned neural superchargers
- Patch_CompAssignableToPawn_NeuralSupercharger_PostExposeData: Deduplicates assigned pawns</description>
